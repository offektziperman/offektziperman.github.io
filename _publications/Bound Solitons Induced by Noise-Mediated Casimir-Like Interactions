excerpt: 'We study experimentally and theoretically the steady states of two-soliton waveforms that form stationary
bound states in a  ber laser, passively mode locked by a nonlinear-multimode-interference-based saturable ab-
sorber. We control the steady state separation by changing the laser parameters, and in particular demonstrate a
dynamical transition between loosely-bound states where the the solitons interact via the noise-mediated Casimir-
like interactions, and tightly-bound states dominated by coherent overlap interactions. We show that the measured
pulse separations of the loosely bound pairs are well-described by the NMI theory, and present a steady state phase
diagram that captures the transitions between the loosely- and tightly-bound states as an intrinsic consequence of
the form of the noise-mediated interaction e ective potential.'

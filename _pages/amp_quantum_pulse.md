Quantum states of light are the key ingredients for quantum technologies such as quantum sensing, communication, and certain computation platforms. It has long been known that there is a deep connection between nonlinear physics and quantum optics, and that creation and manipulation of quantum states of light requires nonlinearity. In addition, most of the interesting phenomena in nonlinear optics are tightly connected to the inherently multimode nature of light, such as the generation of new frequencies via nonlinear processes. Nevertheless, the multimode aspects of nonlinearities in quantum optics have received only little attention.

Studying massive clumps in high redshift, we look into the survivability of clumps. Some clumps are relatively short lived, disrupting over a few Myr while others are long lived living for hundreds of Myr. The goal of the project is to understand what determines the fate of a clump, whether it will be short lived (SLC) or long lived (LLC). We use a combination of analytical modeling and data analysis of pre-existing heavy numerical simulations. We take into account the feedback from supernova. Here is an example of a simulated clump evolving in time and converting its gas into stars.

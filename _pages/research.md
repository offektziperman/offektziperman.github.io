## Quantum optics with free electrons - Experiment 1
<div>
<img src="/images/UTEM.png" align="right" alt="Research Topic 1 Image" width=100px/>
<p>
In this project we study the quantum optical interactions of relativisitic (70% of the speed of light) free electrons with quantum emitters such as perovskite quantum dots and Nitrogen Vacancey centers in diamond. Although the electrons are relativisitic, our system allows us to easily observe even a single photon exchange in their energy gain and loss spectrum. With this strong tool, we are looking for collective superradiant interactions between the free electrons and the quantum emitters.

## Soliton Interactions - Experiment
<div>
    <img src="/images/soliton_concept.jpeg" align="right" alt="Research Topic 2 Image" height=100px/>
    <p>
In this project we study the nonlinear interactions between pulses of light in a fiber laser. Solitons are special types of localized waves which mantain their shape while propagating. Being nonlinear creatures, solitons can interact, collide and form bound states. We found that we can induce a transition between incoherent and coherent bound states of solitons by scanning the laser gain, controling their separation over two orders of magnitude and transitioning between a relative phase-fluctuating and a phase-locked state. We also modeled this transition theoretically utilizing the recently devoloped noise mediated interaction foralism for ultra-long range soliton interactions. Look [here](https://offektziperman.github.io/soliton/) for more information. <br>

    <p>
In 1954 Robert Dicke refined our understanding of spontaneous emission by showing that identical emitters, coupled identically to an electromagnetic field will exhibit either enhanced or suppressed emission due to constructive or destructive interference between decay paths, superradiance and subradiance. In this project we studied the quantum optical state of light emitted from a system of quantum entangled emitters, we studied the affects of emitters positions, interactions, losses, initial conditions and more, showing how these degrees of freedom can be leveraged for creating quantum states of light that are important for quantum technologies.    <br>

    <p>
Many galaxies at high redshift are clumpy, meaning they have areas that are overdense compared to the sorroundings. Clumps are formed when the force of gravitation overcomes the forces due to pressure and rotation causing a local inward collapse of mass. Studying massive clumps in high redshift, we look into the survivability of clumps. Some clumps are relatively short lived, disrupting over a few Myr while others are long lived living for hundreds of Myr. The goal of the project is to understand what determines the fate of a clump, whether it will be short lived (SLC) or long lived (LLC). We use a combination of analytical modeling and data analysis of pre-existing heavy numerical simulations. We take into account the feedback from supernova. Here is an example of a simulated clump evolving in time and converting its gas into stars.

## X-ray scintillation with quantum optics
<div>
    <img src="/images/x-ray.png" align="right" alt="Research Topic 3 Image" height=120px/>
    <p>
Scintillation, the emission of light by materials when absorbing high-energy quanta or particles, has applications in medical imaging and particle physics experiments. Accurate measurements of scintillator properties—yield, energy resolution, and lifetime—are essential both during the development and the use of scintillators. In this project, we study how the quantum optical properties of scintillation light can help us characterize scintillators and even improve their signal to noise ratio.

|**Quantum optics with free electrons**|                                     |
|:--------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
|In this project we study the quantum optical interactions of relativisitic (70% of the speed of light) free electrons with quantum emitters such as pervoskite quantum dots and Nitrogen Vacancey centers in diamond. Although the electrons are relativisitic, our system allows us to easily observe even a single photon exchange in their energy gain and loss spectrum. With this strong tool, we are looking for collective superradiant interactions between the free electrons and the quantum emitters.|<img src="/images/UTEM.png" width="2000" />|
|**Soliton Interactions**|                                     |
|In this project we study the nonlinear interactions between pulses of light in a fiber laser. Solitons are special types of localized waves which mantain their shape while propagating. Being nonlinear creatures, solitons can interact, collide and form bound states. We found that we can induce a transition between incoherent and coherent bound states of solitons by scanning the laser gain, controling their separation over two orders of magnitude and transitioning between a relative phase-fluctuating and a phase-locked state. We also modeled this transition theoretically utilizing the recently devoloped noise mediated interaction foralism for ultra-long range soliton interactions.|<img src="/images/soliton_concept.jpeg" width="2000" />|

|**Collective emission from quantum emitters**|                                     |
|:--------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
|In 1954 Robert Dicke refined our understanding of spontaneous emission by showing that identical emitters, coupled identically to an electromagnetic field will exhibit either enhanced or suppressed emission due to constructive or destructive interference between decay paths, superradiance and subradiance. In this project we studied the quantum optical state of light emitted from a system of quantum entangled emitters, we studied the affects of emitters positions, interactions, losses, initial conditions and more, showing how these degrees of freedom can be leveraged for creating quantum states of light that are important for quantum technologies.|<img src="/images/Figure 1.png" width="2000" />|

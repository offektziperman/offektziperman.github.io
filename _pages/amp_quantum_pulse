Quantum states of light are the key ingredients for quantum technologies such as quantum sensing, communication, and certain computation platforms. It has long been known that there is a deep connection between nonlinear physics and quantum optics, and that creation and manipulation of quantum states of light requires nonlinearity. Most of the interesting phenomena in nonlinear optics are tightly connected to the inherently multimode nature of light, such as the generation of new frequencies via nonlinear processes. Nevertheless, the multimode aspects of nonlinearities in quantum optics have received only little attention.

Studying massive clumps in high redshift, we look into the survivability of clumps. Some clumps are relatively short lived, disrupting over a few Myr while others are long lived living for hundreds of Myr. The goal of the project is to understand what determines the fate of a clump, whether it will be short lived (SLC) or long lived (LLC). We use a combination of analytical modeling and data analysis of pre-existing heavy numerical simulations. We take into account the feedback from supernova. Here is an example of a simulated clump evolving in time and converting its gas into stars.

Our theoretical model compares the energy input by supernovas in the clump to its gravitational binding energy. We define a quantity S, the ratio of the gravitational to supernova inputed energy. According to the model, if S is smaller than a criticle value ~0.5, the clump's gas could be lost by outflow. Below you can see the distribution of the S parameter in the Vela simulations (Vela 6 having increased feedback), the value of S=0.5 splits the long lived and short lived clumps.

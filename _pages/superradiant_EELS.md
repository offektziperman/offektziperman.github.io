**Interactions of a free electron and quantum emitters**
When a free-electron passes near a quantum emitter, its monopole can interact with the dipole of quantum emitters, and can drive a transition. 

**Superradiant Cathoduluminecence**
Cathoduluminecence is the emission of light from fast free electrons, we are looking to shape the wavefunction of free electrons to make them "bunched", and cause their field to have a distinct frequency component, allowing them to coherently drive a transition in a quantum emitter.

We utilize either nitrogen vacancy centers or silicon vacancy centers in diamond.

**Quantum emitter superradiance**
Many quantum emitters are excited by a laser from a specific angle, and then a free electron passes by the emitters and interacts with them. The velocity of the electron is chosen such that the electron-quantum emitters interaction is phase-matched and scales as the number of quantum emitters squared. Hopefully allowing us to observe it in the electron energy spectrum.

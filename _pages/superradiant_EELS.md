**Free electron superradiance**
The goal is to use free electrons to coherently drive an optical transition of a quantum emitter. The wave function of multiple free electrons is shaped by a laser field and propagation such that they are bunched in time. Their electric field then has a particular frequency component which is enhanced. This can be used to make free electrons coherently drive a quantum emitter (such as Silicon Vacancy centers in diamond). Such techniques are commonly used in free electron lasers but not in the optical regime.

**Quantum emitter superradiance**
Many quantum emitters are excited by a laser from a specific angle, and then a free electron passes by the emitters and interacts with them. The velocity of the electron is chosen such that the electron-quantum emitters interaction is phase-matched and scales as the number of quantum emitters squared. Hopefully allowing us to observe it in the electron energy spectrum.

Welcome! My name is Offek Tziperman and I am a Masters degree student at the Technion Institute of Technology, Israel and a visiting student at Niels Bohr Institute in Denmark. I recieved a Bsc in physics from The Hebrew University in Jerusalem (2022). 

My research covers many fun topics including quantum optics, nonlinear optics, quantum information, free electron-light interactions and astrophysics. You can learn more about my research in the Research section. A list of my published work can be found on the Publications page.
